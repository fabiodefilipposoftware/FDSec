## A sort of Antivirus

I am trying to create an Antivirus too.

## WARNING:

Read and check the code before compiling and running it in production!
## How to use it:

Create a new project and paste the code inside Program.cs, read and check, compile it and execute the binary! I suggest Framework 5.0 or higher!
