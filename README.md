I am trying to create an Antivirus too.

## ⚠️WARNING⚠️:

Read and check the code before compiling and running it in production (Virtual Machine)!
## How to use it:

1. Create a new project in Visual Studio;
2. Paste the code inside Program.cs;
3. <strong>READ</strong> and <strong>CHECK</strong> the code;
4. Compile it and execute the binary!

I suggest Framework 4.7 or higher!

## Features
- Recursive scan processes;
- Arbitrary scan single file;
- Recursive scan remote ip connections;
- automatic exclusion of system software (by whitelist hashes);

## Technologies
- blacklist and whitelist of sha256 hashes;
- signatures;
- blacklist of malicious ip;
